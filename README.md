# 🚀 DevOps Project: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo

This project is a full DevOps pipeline built around a cloud-native microservices-based application inspired by Google’s [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). It demonstrates modern best practices in CI/CD, Kubernetes, observability, GitOps, and infrastructure as code (IaC).
